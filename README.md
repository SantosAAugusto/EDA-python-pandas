# Description
This project aim to answer Business Questions using Pandas, one of the most important Python libraries for Data Science.
First, a Exploratory Data Analysis was made, to understand the Dataset.
After, the questions were answered using queries and plots.

## Material 
The Dataset used in this project is a CSV. file, that was imported to a Jupyter Notebook with Pandas.

# Pandas 
Pandas is an open-source Python library specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful, easy-to-use data structures and tools for working with structured data, making it one of the most essential libraries in the Data Science ecosystem. The name "Pandas" is derived from "Panel Data," a term used in statistics for multidimensional structured data sets.

## Uses of Pandas in Data Science
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Pandas is widely used to clean and preprocess raw data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a usable format.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: It helps in summarizing data, calculating statistics, and visualizing trends using integration with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Data Transformation**: Pandas allows for easy reshaping, merging, and pivoting of data, which is crucial for preparing data for machine learning models.

- **Handling Time Series Data**: Pandas has robust tools for working with time-series data, such as resampling, time zone handling, and rolling window calculations.

- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Pandas works seamlessly with other data science libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, making it a cornerstone of the data science workflow.
